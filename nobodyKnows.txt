Nobody knows why a ninja dramatically painted a screaming dead body.
Nobody knows why a monster regularly laughed at the screaming cake either.
Nobody knows which toe tastes best in toe soup.
Nobody knows why I want to itch my nose.
Nobody knows why onions grow when it snows.
Nobody knows why strangers are strange.
